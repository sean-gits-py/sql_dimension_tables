# Enterprise Data Model

## Overview

This repository contains the DBML (Database Markup Language) representation of an enterprise logical data model. The purpose of this model is to provide a comprehensive structure for managing complex organizational data, capturing key entities, relationships, and constraints necessary for enterprise operations.

## Purpose

The enterprise logical data model is designed to standardize data management practices within an organization. It facilitates the efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of business information, supporting various business functions such as sales, procurement, human resources, and customer service. This model serves as a blueprint for database implementation, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and scalability.

## Key Components

### 1. **Entities and Relationships**

The model consists of several entities representing different aspects of the enterprise, such as organizations, persons, contacts, products, orders, and transactions. Key relationships between these entities are defined to represent the business processes and interactions within the organization.

### 2. **Core Tables**

- **Organization**: Captures information about different organizations within the enterprise ecosystem.
- **Person**: Contains personal information for individuals associated with the organization.
- **Contact**: Stores contact details linked to persons.
- **Account**: Represents business relationships with various organizations and channels.
- **Product**: Details product information, including brand and category associations.
- **SKU**: Defines stock-keeping units for inventory management.
- **Order**: Records customer order information with multiple product line items.
- **Invoice**: Manages invoice details linked to orders and transaction records.
- **Inventory**: Tracks inventory levels across different locations.
- **Corp Employee**: Contains information about employees, linking them to departments and divisions.
- **Channel**: Defines the business channels through which products and services are distributed.

### 3. **Supporting Tables**

- **Categories and Subcategories**: Organize products into hierarchical groupings.
- **Region, State, and Postal Code**: Provide geographical information for locations.
- **Corp Division and Corp Dept**: Define organizational structure and departmental management.
- **Txn Ledger and Settlement Ledger**: Capture financial transaction and settlement details.
- **Cust Serv Events**: Track customer service interactions and resolutions.

### 4. **Design Principles**

- **Normalization**: The model follows normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support growing data volumes and additional business requirements.
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates various business scenarios through configurable entities and relationships.
- **Timeliness**: Includes timestamp fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`) for audit and tracking purposes.

## Usage

This DBML model can be used as a reference for implementing the physical database schema. Developers can utilize tools like [DBML tools](https://www.dbml.org/) to generate SQL code, visualize database diagrams, and collaborate on database design.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance and expand this model are welcome. Please ensure changes adhere to the overall design principles and maintain compatibility with existing entities and relationships.
